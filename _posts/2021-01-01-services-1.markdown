title: What is hypnotherapy?
description: |
---
  Hypnotherapy is the therapeutic practice of hypnosis – which is a naturally occurring, deep state of relaxation where the subconscious mind is receptive to new behaviors, beliefs, and habits. When you’re unable to reach your goals, it’s often due to the subconscious mind – which gravitates towards what is known and familiar. An innate response for survival, but not so helpful for creating change! Hypnotherapy helps create new "knowns" within the subconscious mind using your personal desired outcomes to achieve goals. It also allows you to access parts of the mind that you’re not ordinarily connected to throughout the day.
