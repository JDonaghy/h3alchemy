With the tools of Hellenistic Astrology, you can find grace, compassion, and deep understanding of your life. During a Natal Chart Reading, you’ll discover patterns, themes, areas of focus, what might be "up" for you, and why. Hippocrates himself – the father of medicine – used traditional astrology for better understanding in treating patients. There are a number of differences between Hellensitc Astrology and typical Western astrology, such as the use of whole sign houses and traditional planetary rulerships. So if your horoscopes or online charts haven’t fully resonated, this may well be a game-changer!
