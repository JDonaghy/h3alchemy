Deep gratitude to Tracie for her hypnotherapy session. I was not familiar with hypnotherapy, and she did everything she had to do to 
make me comfortable with the process, which is good; she also did a lot to prepare
the session, and I really felt she was taking interest in me and my issues, 
which I appreciated; I felt she understood rightly their essence, even better. 
Most important, I am delighted with where the process led.  I felt I was in great hands for the process, and it's in my hands now. 
Thank you again for being there!
